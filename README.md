Desktop Pet made in Pygame

You can add your own pet by adding them into the Sprites folder(Located in the Assets Folder)

Your sprites must include a animation folder for walking and idle (with each frame numbered 1 - # of frames).

To configure your pet you must add a .txt into your pets file name Configuration 

there are several Configurable options such as their width, height, and fps. 

To add configurable setting you must put in commands in this format:
  ;cmd = #;

Example:
  ;W = 100;
This would Change the width of the sprite to 100 pixels.

Available commands:
  W : sets width
  H : sets height
  fps : sets fps
  
By default pets are 100 pixels by 100 pixels and animate at 10 frames per second.
